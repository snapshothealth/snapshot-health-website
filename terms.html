        <p>These Patient App & Website Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the SnapShot Health Inc website located at https://snapshothealth.io and any patient-facing mobile or web application provided by SnapShot Health Inc (collectively, the "Service").</p>
        
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Role of SnapShot Health</h2>
        
        <p>SnapShot Health Inc ("SnapShot") provides a technology platform that enables patients to view health information made available by their Healthcare Providers and to transmit patient-generated health data, including manual readings, to those Providers.</p>
        
        <p>SnapShot does <strong>not</strong> provide medical advice, medical diagnosis, medical treatment, clinical decision-making, clinical monitoring, clinical oversight, or any obligation to review, interpret, escalate, respond to, or act upon patient data.</p>
        
        <p>SnapShot is not a healthcare provider and does not enter into a physician–patient or other healthcare provider–patient relationship with you.</p>

        <h2>2. Healthcare Providers Are Responsible for Care</h2>
        
        <p>All medical care, clinical services, treatment decisions, and health-related advice are provided solely by your Healthcare Provider. Your Healthcare Provider is independent of SnapShot and is solely responsible for:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Determining medical necessity and appropriateness of care</li>
            <li>Reviewing, interpreting, and responding to patient data</li>
            <li>Making all clinical decisions</li>
            <li>Establishing monitoring protocols, escalation criteria, and response timing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Any information displayed through the Service is presented as received and is not reviewed, validated, or acted upon by SnapShot.</p>

        <h2>3. No Emergency Use</h2>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <p><strong>THE SERVICE IS NOT INTENDED FOR EMERGENCY OR URGENT MEDICAL USE.</strong></p>
            <p>The Service is not monitored in real time. If you believe you are experiencing a medical emergency, call <strong>911 immediately</strong>. Do not rely on the Service for emergency care.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>4. Patient-Generated Data and Manual Readings</h2>
        
        <p>If you submit manual readings or other information through the Service, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>You are <strong>solely and exclusively responsible</strong> for the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of all information you submit</li>
            <li>Manual readings may be inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading</li>
            <li>SnapShot does not verify, validate, correct, monitor, or review submitted data</li>
            <li>Your Healthcare Provider may rely on submitted data as provided</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>SnapShot disclaims all liability arising from inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, or erroneous patient-submitted data.</p>

        <h2>5. No Duty to Monitor or Respond</h2>
        
        <p>SnapShot expressly disclaims any duty to monitor, review, respond to, escalate, triage, or act upon patient data.</p>
        
        <p>SnapShot does not guarantee that:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Data will be reviewed within any specific timeframe</li>
            <li>Providers will be notified of submissions</li>
            <li>Alerts or thresholds will result in provider action</li>
        </ul>
